Ode to Marguerite Roth - See her Github project [vue-d3-dataviz-starter](https://github.com/margueriteroth/vue-d3-dataviz-starter/tree/main)

I can have a short attention span when it comes to debugging and dev environments make it even shorter... anyway, I could not clone her repo and get it to work on my machine so I started a new project and npm installed all the packages and copied the code over and got it to work on my machine.
